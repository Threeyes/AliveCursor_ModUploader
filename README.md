# AliveCursor_ModUploader
I use this project to upload workshop items (you can find them [here](https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199378980403/myworkshopfiles/?appid=1606490)) for my indie Steam App [AliveCursor](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1606490/_/) using [SDK](https://github.com/Threeyes/AliveCursorSDK).
This project aimed for demonstrating how to using Components or Scripts to bring diffenent kinds of models alive, and are for experimental purposes only. The items inside this project will get updated frequently, incompatible with old config data, so they may be imperfect for users. Think of this project as a tutorial, it won't cover every aspect but it will be a good start.

## Note
+ **Don't** try to reupload any items using this project because their id is settled in `WorkshopItemInfo.asset`! If you want to use or modify some items in this project, please create a new item in your project using `Item Manager` Window, then copy all assets under `Assets/Items/(DesireItemName)` folder to your project's new item dir except `WorkshopItemInfo.asset`. 
+ I will keep uploading different kinds of models and creating general-purpose scripts out of them, feel free to contact me what elses you wanna see on your screen.
