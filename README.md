# AliveCursor_ModUploader
I use this project to upload workshop items for my indie Steam App [AliveCursor](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1606490/_/) using [SDK](https://github.com/Threeyes/AliveCursorSDK), you can find all uploaded items [here](https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199378980403/myworkshopfiles/?appid=1606490);

# Note
**Don't** try to reupload any items using this project because their id is settled in `WorkshopItemInfo.asset`! If you want to use or modify some items in this project, please create a new item in your project using `Item Manager` Window, then copy all assets under `Assets/Items/(DesireItemName)` folder to your project's new item dir except `WorkshopItemInfo.asset`.
